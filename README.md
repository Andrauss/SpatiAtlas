# SpatiAtlas
## Android example for the [android-spatialite](https://github.com/sevar83/android-spatialite) library.

Demonstrates a geospatial database bundled as a file asset and wrapped into a content provider. 
The database contains a few large tables of geometry data - Italy towns, regions and municipalities, 
which are served by the content provider and then displayed (naively) as vector layers into Google Maps.
